This is a maze I designed for android.

It took me around a week and ahalf to complete this project due to internet difficulties.
I do admit it took me awhile to figure out certain elements of the scripts such as : making the collectables clickable, making the particles go up, and sound. It wasn't difficult. I just didn't know where to look to get started so it took me awhile to get the ball rolling.
I loved the absolute freedom I had to make whatever maze I wanted to. I had my friends and family test every inch of it after every iteration until they were sick of it.
